# ANOMEME - Social Intent Terminal

**Memecoin trading is broken.** Traders get rekt by MEV bots, rug pulls, and snipers while trying to catch social momentum.

**ANOMEME fixes this** using Anoma's intent system for automated, MEV-protected memecoin trading based on social signals.

## 🚀 What Is This?

Set up "intents" that automatically trade memecoins based on social signals while Anoma's solvers handle MEV protection and risk analysis.

**Example**: "If Elon tweets about DOGE, buy $100 worth with max 20% loss protection."

### Key Features
- Social Signal Trading (Twitter/Telegram → Automated trades)
- MEV Protection via Anoma's solver network
- AI-powered rug pull detection
- Intent-based "set and forget" trading
